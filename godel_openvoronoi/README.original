OpenVoronoi README. Last update 2015-02-12.

The OpenVoronoi project aims to produce an algorithm for calculating
the 2D voronoi-diagram for point, line-segment, and circular-arc sites.
Currently point-sites and line-segment sites work. Arc-sites are being worked
on. The incremental topology-oriented (Sugihara-Iri and/or Held) 
algorithm is used (see References).

The core algorithm is in C++ with python bindings using Boost Python. 
There are many python examples that use VTK for visualization.
The tests use a random polygon generator (https://github.com/aewallin/randompolygon) and a 
font-geometry generator based on FreeType (https://github.com/aewallin/truetype-tracer)

OpenVoronoi is written by Anders Wallin (anders.e.e.wallin "at" gmail.com)
and released under GPLv3 (see COPYING).

In February 2015 Rogach published a Java port called jopenvoronoi (https://github.com/Rogach/jopenvoronoi)

Voronoi diagrams are used for many purposes in computational geometry,
but the motivation for OpenVoronoi has mainly been 2D offset-generation
(see offset.hpp) for cnc mill toolpath calcuations. An experimental 
approximate medial-axis filter (medial_axis.hpp) has been added.

Build/Install instructions

From PPA
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:anders-e-e-wallin/cam
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openvoronoi

From source
$ git clone git://github.com/aewallin/openvoronoi.git
$ cd openvoronoi
$ mkdir bld
$ cd bld
$ cmake ../src
$ make
$ sudo make install

Documentation
Doxygen documentation can be built with "make doc"
A white-paper on the algorithm and solvers in LyX format is located in /doc. 
It has its own CMakeLists.txt file which builds a PDF file.

Tests
Both c++ and python tests are found in src/test/. These are run with CTest.
In the build-directory either "make test" or "ctest" will run all tests. 
You can run only tests that have e.g. "ttt" in the test-name with
"ctest -R ttt"
Currently the tests do not produce any output (png or svg output could be an option?)


Organization
doc/        has documentation in lyx format, with figures in asymptote format. 
            Build a PDF with the CMakeLists.txt in this directory.
cpp_examples/ has c++ examples (more needed)
python_examples/ has Python examples. Many use VTK and VTK's python bindingd for visualization.
src/        has the source for the main algorithm
src/solvers has vd-vertex solver code
src/py      has python wrapping code
src/common  has common classes not specific to voronoi diagrams
src/utility input and output from OpenVoronoi to/from various formats

Contributing
See the TODO file. Fork the github repo, create a feature branch, commit yor 
changes, test. Make a short description of your changes and create a pull request.
Follow the coding-style of the existing code. One fix/feature per pull request.
Contributed code must comply with the GPL. Provide short doxygen-formatted 
documentation in the code.

VRONI/Martin Held. This code is commercial and not available, as far as
we know. 
http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~held/projects/vroni/vroni.html
Patel (see References) seems to have independently implemented the
same algorithm, we don't know where this code is or under what license it is.

Voro++
BSD-licensed code for 3D voronoi cell computation. May not be useful for 2D toolpath generation?

Triangle
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html
Really a mesh-generator for e.g. finite-element analysis. A constrained Delaunay triangulation could be used to generate a Voronoi diagram for point and line inputs.
